# Open Build Service 2.10
#


Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium which installs OBS on hard disk now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has information for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will
happen automatically.


Features
========

Generic:
 * replaced sysv init scripts with systemd files
 * Add binary release tracking data for containers.
 * Add support to collect performance metrics with InfluxDB
 * Amazon EC2/ Microsoft Azure cloud upload support
 * Text fields are stored as 4 byte UTF-8 which allows to use emojis. To use this
   feature, switch database.yml to utf8mb4 encoding
 * Added `beta` environment in 'config/feature.yml' to toggle features in the beta program.
 * Bugowners of a project/package now receive notifications about new comments
 * Request pre-approval support. Requests will be accepted when last review gets accepted.

   users unless they acknowledge them.

User Interface:
 * Improved UI/UX for package live build log (hints & start/stop loading)
 * Do not show excluded entries in package build results by default.
 * Refactored the view of the binaries page that before was just a list of links that
   pointed to the details page. Now you can download the files and upload images to
   the cloud directly from here.

Intentional changes:
====================

  * always run services on expanded link sources

  * The format of the OBS options.yml is now distinguishing between Rails environments.
    You can convert your old configuration by running:
      (cd /srv/www/obs/api/; rake migrate_options_yml)

  * OBS is now using the lograge gem to generate production logs. We are now logging (in one line per request):
    * Timestamp
    * Request: Method + Controller + Action + Path + Params
    * Response status
    * Duration: Overall / View / DB
    * Remote IP
    * User login

  You can see an example of the output here:
    ```
    method=POST path=/comments format=js controller=Webui::CommentsController action=create status=200 duration=1436.57 view=77.25 db=13.92 params={"utf8"=>"âœ“", "commentable_type"=>"Project", "commentable_id"=>"1", "comment"=>{"body"=>"hola que tal"}, "commit"=>"Add comment"} host=127.0.0.1 time=2018-05-14 15:59:03 +0000 user=Admin
    ```

 * In previous releases it was possible to delete attributes through
   /source/<project>/_attribute/?namespace=OBS&name=VeryImportantProject (or similiar
   for packages). You need to follow the documentation now and the proper
   route is /source/<project>/_attribute/OBS:VeryImportantProject

 * GET '/attribute/:attribute' route responded with a 400 when the attribute type
   did not exist. It now returns a 404 status.

 * GET '/source/<project>/_attribute' allowed to filter by namespace. This was never
   documented and was removed now. '/_attribute' will return all attributes, while
   '/_attribute/:attribute' keeps returning only the given attribute (as documented)

  * The 'commenter' and 'commenters' payload of Comment events used to contain user ids.
    They now contain the user login name instead.
    Run the data migrations to convert events in the old format:
    'rails data:migrate RAILS_ENV=production'

  * Messages (for projects/packages) deprecated. The API routes
    below /message/ are deprecated and will be removed in the next
    version.

  * Deprecated Ratings. The following API routes are deprecated and will be removed
    in the next version:
    - GET /statistics/highest_rated?limit=<limit>
    - GET /statistics/rating/<project>/<package>
    - PUT /statistics/rating/<project>/<package>

  * Project and package release operations used to return a 403 permission
    error also on configuration errors. This is a 404 now:
    - POST /source/<project>?cmd=release
    - POST /source/<project>/<package>?cmd=release

  * Public route dropped for reading patchinfo
    - GET 'patchinfo/read_patchinfo'
