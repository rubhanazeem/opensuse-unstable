# Release Notes for openSUSE Build Service 1.7     (PRE-RELEASE)
#

Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions.

README.UPDATE has informations for updaters.

Please note that the new SLP service discovery support is
recommended to be used. bs_worker instances will find all
OBS server instances in the entire network. You can disable
this via syconfig settings:
  /etc/sysconfig/obs-server
  /etc/sysconfig/obs-worker

The former called "frontend" is now called "api".
The former called "webclient" is now called "webui".

New processes are

 * bs_signerd
   Needed when a signing key is configured in BSConfig.pm

 * bs_warden
   Optionally, detects hanging build hosts

 * delayed_jobs
   Needed to run regular jobs on api instance which creates
   cache content.

 * Cron jobs
   api and webui requires cronjobs to log the worker status
   and to generate the load graphes. These are active by default
   in obs-server rpm package. Otherwise templates for the 
   cronjobs can be found in dist/ directory of git tree.

Main new features are:

 * Rewritten dependency solver in scheduler which gave
   a significant speed up. It is using the SAT solver via perl-BSSolv
   module.

 * Speedup in webui by using new xml parser

 * Attribute system to store all kind of information for projects,
   packages or sub packages as defined by the server admin.

 * Extended request handling
   - new request types (delete or change_devel)
   - new review mechanism

 * clean product build support (inside of chroot enviroment)

 * Improved source handling of branched packages (less often 
   created conflicts).
   branch command is creating full copies now with additional _link

 * webui is themable now

 * Build trigger reporting, the reason why a package got triggered
   to build is stored now and requestable.

 * Scheduler status reporting for each repository

Regression:

 * The Download on Demand feature got not yet re-implemented to support
   the new scheduler SAT support. 

Preview features are:

 * patchinfo aka maintenance handling, this is not complete yet.

 * source service handler to let server and client side modules
   prepare sources in the same way.
