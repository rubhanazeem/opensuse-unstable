README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace 
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will 
happen automatically.


Known Regressions:
==================

* read access feature enhancements of MeeGo branch (named 1.8 in git)
  are not included with this release. 

  Do *NOT* update from 1.8 to this release.

  We will merge these branches in a later release.


* API calls which got deprecated with 1.0 release got removed:
  /platform       (use /build or /search/repository_id instead)
  /repository     (use /build or /search/repository_id instead)
  /project        (use /source instead)
  /package        (use /source instead)

* The OBS Appliance comes with package signing enabled by default now.
  As consequence some operations like project creation may take a 
  long time if your hardware has no hardware random number generator.
  (gpg key creation needs a safe random generator source).


Features:
=========

* Revised webui, new layout with more funcationality.

* Anonymous access mode for webui
  => to be configured in api  config/options.yml

* Improved permission system:
  - User group support for roles and requests

* Improved request system:
  - Review mechanism
    - New "reviewer" role to set default reviewers for a package or project.
      These can be users or groups.
    http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Concepts/Review

  - New requests types for
    - set bugowner
    - add role

* Project link mechanism
  http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Concepts/ProjectLinking

* Build job scheduling strategies got configurable
  http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/Concepts/BuildSchedulingStrategies

* New fair build job dispatcher is distributing the jobs based on importance
  and former used build times now.

* Build cycle dependencies are accessable via api and webui now.

* History for meta files like _meta and _prjconf

* Project/Package undelete feature

* Source service are stabelized and enabled by default.
  - default services for downloading files and to verify them are available.
  - basic support in webui for source services

* Lots of smaller improvements and bugfixes



Changes:
========

* xml files are validated by the api

* "expansion error" state got renamed to "unresolved".

* New "signing" state.

* For cross architecture compiling support:
  CBpreinstall and CBinstall prjconf directives added.
  - CBPreinstall: add to preinstall section if emulator_arch
  - CBinstall: add to install section if emulator_arch
  - as with VMinstall, there's no dependency resolution. 
    Add all needed dependencies manually.


Requirements:
=============

* The OBS server should not run on a system with less than 2GB memory. 
  4GB is recommended, esp. when the same system is also building packages.

* Use osc 0.127 or later to get access to the new features.
