1. Inter Buildservice Connectivity
----------------------------------

To make the projects of another buildservice available at
http://remote.buildservice.net available, create a project in your
build service containing a "remoteurl" element.

Example:

<project name="openSUSE.org">
  <title>The openSUSE Build Service</title>
  <remoteurl>https://api.opensuse.org/public</remoteurl>
</project>

This allows access to the sources and repositories of the remote
service:
- repository pathes can contain remote repository elements
- source links can refer to remote sources
- aggregations can refer to remote packages

Refering to a remote project works by prepending the project name
of the project containing the remoteurl to the remote project name.
For example, project openSUSE:Tools from the openSUSE build service
would be available by using "openSUSE.org:openSUSE:Tools".

Automatic rebuild triggering also works for remote resources.
You must be the build service administrator to create projects
containing the remoteurl element.

Limitations (aka bugs to be fixed):
- each build service can only be referenced once in your project tree
- remote projects cannot itself be remote on the other service
- remote aggregates must specify which packages to take the binaries
  from
- failing builds because of server unavaiability will not automatically
  be retried

Hava a lot of fun!
