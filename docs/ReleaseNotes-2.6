# Open Build Service 2.6
#


Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will
happen automatically.


Features
========

 * Debian live build image generation support (thanks to Jan Blunck)

 * webui handles package sources supporting project links.

 * priorization system for requests

 * optional binary package tracking, can be used to track released packages.
   Esp. important for maintained products.

 * Groups can have maintainers now, who can modify the member list

 * Requests can have a priority now. Request search is sorting by the priority
   first and by the age of the request second.

 * The request history system got a big overhaul
   - reviews have a history too now
   - more fine granular history elements which can be displayed more flexible

 * EXPERIMENTAL: Entire projects can be linked now with frozen source revisions.

Changes on purpose:
===================

 * some delayed jobs run in seperate queues now to avoid to block other jobs

Incompatible changes:
=====================

 * You get also an update of sphinx searchd. The on-disk db files became
   incompatible, so please remove all files in following directory to
   enforce a re-index to avoid problems:

      /srv/www/obs/api/db/sphinx/production/

 * maintenance tag handling via _channel files got replaced with an option
   to re-define the updateinfo scheme template.
     We are only aware of one instance using this feature, in case it troubles
   someone else, please speak up and we will introduce some compatibility handling.

 * Reworked request history:
    - We do not support to import history elements of requests anymore.
      => do not update OBS instances older than 2.4 directly to OBS 2.6!
        (we do support updates from 2.5 only anyway)
    - Also old clients will not show history anymore by default. Use osc 0.148
      for full new support of request histories


Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here.

Also stopping services may not kill all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them. We heard also about trashed MySQL databases when using
systemd.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to avoid the systemd mapper:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start
